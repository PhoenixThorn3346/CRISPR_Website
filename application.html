                <div class="text"> HIV works by inserting itself into the genome of its
                  host CD4 white blood cells, and while it can remain dormant for years,
                  and there are medical treatments to reduce its effects, there are
                  currently no cures or treatments to permanently inactivate the virus.
                  In 2015, scientists used CRISPR to cut HIV out of living cells of a
                  patient in the laboratory. The following year, scientists carried out
                  an experiment with rats which had HIV. BY injecting CRISPR into the
                  rats’ tails, they were able to remove 48% of the virus from the DNA
                  of their cells. In 2020, scientists from Temple University and
                  University of Nebraska Medical Center showed that in treating mice
                  with Human T-Cells they were able to eradicate HIV by first giving
                  long acting anti-retrovirals and then introducing CRISPR. At the end
                  of the experiment, the scientists could not find any trace of HIV in
                  9 of the 23 mice that received the treatment. </div>

                <div class="text"> Researchers have used the Cas9-CRISPR system to create
                  mosquitoes that are resistant to the parasite that causes malaria
                  (Plasmodium falciparum). Scientists using Cas9-CRISPR edited the genome
                  of the mosquitos to remove certain genes and replace them with human
                  engineered DNA constructs. These new genes make the mosquitoes resistant
                  to the parasite that causes malaria. When the new genes were inserted
                  into a male mosquito, approximately 99% of the offspring carried the new
                  gene and resistance. However only 60 to 70% of offspring from female
                  mosquitoes that had the new genes that caused them to be resistant to
                  the parasite. Thus more work needs to be done to ensure that all o
                  ffspring can carry the genetic mutation. </div>

                <div class="text"> While scientists have developed and commercialized
                  methods for treating certain cancers with modified T-Cells (CAR-T therapies),
                  these are not CRISPR based. They only add a protein that will allow the
                  T-cells to attack the cancer. In 2019, scientists at the University of
                  Pennsylvania used CRISPR to genetically modify a patented T-cells to better
                  “see” and kill the cancer. They equipped the T-Cells with a receptor that
                  allows it to attach to the “NY-ESO-1” molecule on the surface of certain
                  cancer cells. They also removed certain genes that reduce the ability of the
                  T-cells to kill the cancer cells once the T-cell attaches itself to the
                  cancer cell. In human testing, they found it was safe in the initial people
                  they tested (2 with advanced multiple myeloma and one with metastatic sarcoma).
                  The patients experienced some side effects, but these were most likely due to the
                  chemotherapy. Further work needs to be done, as only 10% of the T-cells used for
                  the therapy had all the modifications that the scientists wanted to make, and
                  some cells had off-target modifications, which did not cause new cancers. </div>

                <div class="text"> George Church, one of the scientists involved in developing the
                  CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, founded a company to grow organs that can be implanted
                  into humans in animals such as pigs. This requires significant editing of the genes
                  of the organ, so that the human body does not reject the organ. So far trials have
                  moved from just growing the organs, to now being able to implant them in primates.
                  Further work needs to be done to see if these organs will survive in primates, and
                  then be able to be implanted in humans. </div>
