                <h2> How Does the CRISPR System Work in Bacteria? </h2>
                <p> CRISPR stands for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”.
                  It is a specialized region of DNA that has two parts: nucleotide repeats and
                  spacers. The repeated sequences of nucleotides are spread out throughout the
                  CRISPR region, and the spacers are bits of DNA that are scattered among these
                  nucleotides. These spacers, found in the DNA of bacteria, are copies of small
                  pieces of viruses. They allow bacteria to recognize viruses when they invade,
                  helping to protect the bacteria from foreign bodies.
                </p>
                <p> Once the bacteria recognizes the virus with the help of the spacers, it sends
                  the Cas9 enzyme to destroy the virus. In order to direct the Cas9 enzyme to the
                  right place, part of the CRISPR is transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA
                  (crRNA) which consists of a nucleotide repeat and a spacer portion. The Cas9 enzyme
                  then binds to the crRNA and another RNA molecule called the trans-activating
                   crRNA, which guide the Cas9 protein to its target site. Along with the RNA
                   molecules that guide the Cas9 protein to its destination, another safety measure
                   exists in bacteria to help make sure they don’t cut in the wrong place. These safety
                    measures are known as protospacer adjacent motifs, or PAMs, and they serve as
                   tags that sit next to the target DNA sequence. If the Cas9 enzyme does not see a
                    PAM next to its target, it will not cut the DNA sequence, allowing for greater
                    precision and decreasing the likelihood of error.
                </p>
                <p> Once the virus has been recognized and the target site has been properly identified
                  by the Cas9 enzyme, the Cas9 protein in the bacteria cuts apart the target DNA
                  sequence. The Cas9 enzyme essentially acts as a pair of scissors or as a knife,
                  chopping up the virus that has been identified by CRISPR and destroying it by
                  cutting both strands of the DNA double helix to form what is known as a double-stranded break.

                  <h2> How is the CRISPR System Used As a Gene-Editing Tool? </h2>
                  <p> The CRISPR system in bacteria has been adapted for use in plants, animals, human
                    beings, and other organisms in order to edit their genes through multiple techniques.
                    One way in which CRISPR is used for gene editing is through the natural repair
                    process. When the Cas9 protein snips the DNA at the target site, the cell can sense
                    that there is an issue with its DNA. As a result, the cell repairs the break in
                    the DNA by gluing the loose ends back together. However, this often ends up disabling
                    the gene instead of repairing it because it is an error-prone, inefficient process. This can
                    be useful because scientists can use the CRISPR system to target
                    faulty or disease-activating genes and disable them. </p>
                  <p> The CRISPR system has been further developed to allow for more precise and efficient
                    gene editing, such as changing a single nucleotide base or turning specific genes on
                    and off. In order to do so, scientists must use CRISPR-Cas9 to insert a cut in the DNA
                    and then trick the cell into introducing the changes that the scientists want to
                    introduce. Instead of just attacking viruses, scientists have figured out how to make the Cas9
                    target any region of DNA they choose by tweaking the nucleotide sequence of crRNA
                     and making sure that the sequence created is not found anywhere else in the genome. This
                     can be done through another DNA repair method. Instead of gluing the loose ends of
                     the DNA back together, the cell can fill the gap by introducing a sequence of nucleotides
                     by using a short strand of DNA as a template. By providing this DNA template to the
                     cell, scientists are able to rewrite any gene they want to correct. </p>

                <h2> Step-by-Step Instructions </h2>

                <ol>
                  <li>Put on nitrile gloves.</li>
                  <li>Pour 5.55g of Luria Broth Agar Powder (LB Powder) into the 250ml glass bottle
                    – the Luria Broth Agar is the media in which the bacteria will grow.</li>
                  <li>Add 150ml of water to the LB Powder using a conical funnel.</li>
                  <li>Heat the glass bottle (with the lid placed on the top, but not screwed down)
                    in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time until the liquid turns yellow (a total
                    of 2-3 minutes of microwave time is needed).</li>
                  <li>Leave the glass bottle outside to cool down for 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Pour the agar solution onto the sterile plates so that the solution
                    just covers the bottom of the plates.</li>
                  <li>Let the plates cool down outside overnight so that the gel solidifies.</li>
                  <li>Place the plates in the refrigerator.</li>
                  <li>Take one of the plates out of the refrigerator and let it warm up to room
                    temperature.</li>
                  <li>Using an inoculation loop put the E. coli bacteria onto one of the solidified
                    agar that covered the sterile plates.</li>
                  <li>Leave the plates at room temperature for 12-18 hours for the bacteria
                    colonies to grow.</li>
                  <li>In a glass beaker create the TSS solution by mixing 40ml LB broth with
                    5g PEG-3350, 1.5ml of 1M MgCl2, 2.5ml DMSO and mix the solution in a vortex
                    until everything is mixed.</li>
                  <li>Add additional LB broth to the TSS solution to bring the mixture to a
                    volume of 50ml.</li>
                  <li>Filter the TSS solution using the 0.2um filter and syringe.</li>
                  <li>Using a micropipette ¾ fill the micro-centrifuge tubes with the
                    TSS solution from step 12.</li>
                  <li>Using a new inoculation loop, scrape some of the bacteria of a fresh plate
                    and add it to the transformation mix. Make sure the whole loop is in the
                    solution and gently mix it with the transformation mix until it is properly
                    dissolved and there are no clumps. When the mixture turns cloudy, it means
                    it is done.</li>
                  <li>Store the microcentrifuge tubes at 4oC.</li>
                  <li>To a microcentrifuge tube, add 10ul of Cas9 and tracrRNA using a
                    micropipette. Change the tip of the micropipette with every use.</li>
                  <li>Add the template DNA with the help of the pipette to the same mixture.</li>
                  <li>Put the micro-centrifuge tube in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, but
                    make sure the mixture does not freeze. Then leave the tube in warm water
                    at a temperature of 42oC for 30 seconds.</li>
                  <li>Add 500 ul of Luria-Bertani Broth to the mixture using the pipette.</li>
                  <li>Incubate the micro-centrifuge tube at 30oC for 2 hours.</li>
                  <li>Add 1.5 ml of room temperature water to one of the microcentrifuge
                    tubes in step 22, and shake it well to dissolve everything.</li>
                  <li>Add 500ul of Luria-Bertani broth in the component mixture using the micropipette.</li>
                  <li>Incubate the mixture for up to 12 hours at 30oC.</li>
                  <li>On a fresh agar covered plate, spread the solution from step 25 using a fresh
                    inoculation loop., and leave it to dry for at least 10 minutes. After that put
                    the lid back on the plate.</li>
                  <li>In order to prevent condensation of bacteria, flip the plate upside down.</li>
                  <li>Incubate the plate for 16-24hours at 30oC.</li>
                  <li>Small white dots starting to grow on the plate will signal the success
                    of the experiment.</li>
