        <h2> What Is CRISPR? </h2>
        <p>
          CRISPR, short for CRISPR-Cas9, is a powerful tool for editing genomes.
          Simple alterations in DNA sequences can make a significant impact on the life
          of a person, plant, or animal. CRISPR allows scientists to correct genetic
          defects as well as treat and prevent diseases among many other applications
          of this technology. This technology was adapted from bacteria and archaea,
          which possess natural defense mechanisms that allow them to foil attacks by
          viruses and other foreign bodies by cutting up and destroying the DNA of the
          invaders. This mechanism was transferred to more complex organisms through
          CRISPR technology, allowing for gene-editing capabilities that are
          cost-effective and precise.
