          <h2> Why Is the Ethics of CRISPR Such a Major Topic of Debate? </h2>
          <p>
            Genome editing technology is not new, and yet CRISPR has sparked a major debate over
            the ethics of this technology. So what makes CRISPR different from previously available
            genome editing technologies? Biologists have been able to edit genomes for quite some
            time now, but these previous technologies have been expensive, technically challenging,
            and extremely time-consuming. CRISPR, on the other hand, does not require any kind of
            expensive equipment or sophisticated knowledge, and yet it can edit genes or whole genomes
            of many organisms. The ethics debate is not just regarding the effects of gene editing
            technology on human beings - it also concerns other species and the possible effects on
            the environment and on entire ecosystems. The broad capabilities and lack of limitations
            of CRISPR have thus rekindled the debate surrounding the ethics of gene editing technology.

                <h2> Somatic Gene Editing v.s. Germline Gene Editing </h2>
                <p> In order to understand the ethical issues surrounding CRISPR gene editing technology
                  and its use on human beings, it is important to highlight the differences between
                  somatic gene editing and germline gene editing. Somatic gene editing therapies target
                  genes in specific types of cells, and the target cell type is the only kind that is affected.
                  Since changes are limited to the target cell type, any changes made are also limited to the
                  individual receiving the therapies and not their potential offspring. On the other hand,
                  germline gene editing therapies are used on the sperm, egg, or embryo of an individual.
                  Because the changes are made so early in the individual’s development, these edits are
                  copied in every cell. As a result, if the individual were to have children, those children
                  would also inherit the edited genes. This difference, along with the newness of germline
                  editing technology, makes germline therapies much more ethically complicated and controversial
                   than somatic therapies. Below is a break down of the ethical issues concerning CRISPR gene
                   editing technology:

                  <h2> Therapeutic v.s. Non-Therapeutic </h2>
                  <p> One of the main ethical arguments regarding the use of genome editing technologies on human
                    beings is that it can be difficult to differentiate between disease treatment and enhancement,
                    leading to ethical complications in genome editing. Because CRISPR is so advanced and has so
                    few limitations, it can be used not only to treat medical conditions and prevent diseases,
                    but to enhance characteristics of a child. CRISPR can be used to create “designer babies”, as
                    they are termed, raising several ethical concerns. Should parents be allowed to choose the
                    traits of their children, selecting traits such as eye color, hair color, athleticism, and
                    height? Some ethical concerns regarding designer babies are that this technology could
                    increase social and economic divisions in society. If those who are wealthy gain the ability
                    to select desirable traits for their offspring, it could deepen economic divisions in society
                    by creating genetic divisions, as enhanced children would be separate from unenhanced children.
                    Those in favor of “designer babies”, on the other hand, argue that parents already possess a
                    high degree of control over their children, and can shape many of these characteristics
                    through their upbringing, so allowing parents to select traits in their children will not
                    have as severe consequences as critics argue. Even if CRISPR were only used for disease
                    treatment and not for enhancement purposes, there are still ethical concerns involved because
                    the division between therapeutic and non-therapeutic gene therapies is not clear. For example,
                    treating deafness through gene editing is considered therapeutic by some but non-therapeutic
                    by others. As a result, many scientists believe that a clear line must be drawn between
                    treatments for enhancement and those for disease treatment before allowing for the use of
                    CRISPR on human beings.

                <h2> Consent </h2>
                <p> Although some bioethicists argue that parents have a right to prenatal autonomy, which allows
                  them to decide the fate of their children, the issue of consent is another major ethical
                  concern regarding CRISPR gene editing technology. This issue of consent is even more of a
                  concern when regarding CRISPR as opposed to other gene editing technologies because of its
                  ability to significantly alter the genomes of generations to come, not just of one individual
                  embryo. The first issue of consent is whether or not parents are allowed to give consent for
                  gene editing therapies for their offspring. An embryo does not have the ability to provide
                  consent for the procedure, but should parents have the power to give consent for their unborn
                  offspring? This debate is furthered by the concept of germline gene editing. Should parents
                  have the power to give consent for not only their embryo, but for all future generations of
                  offspring? The second issue of consent is that of informed consent. Some bioethicists argue
                  that until there is extensive research done on CRISPR and all of its possible risks are
                  well-known, it is impossible for parents to make a truly informed decision of consent. For
                  this reason, many bioethicists believe that it is not ethical to have parents give consent
                  for the use of CRISPR on their embryo until more research into its risks has been done.

                  <h2> Safety </h2>
                  <p> Another main concern with CRISPR gene editing technology is its safety. Many bioethicists
                    believe that the risks with germline genome editing are so great that any potential benefits
                    of the therapies cannot be justified, at least until much more extensive research is done
                    on the technologies. If the genome editing therapy malfunctions, that mistake would affect
                    every single cell type in the embryo’s body through germline gene editing. Furthermore, that
                    mistake in gene editing would appear in the offspring of that embryo for generations upon
                    generations. Do any potential benefits of CRISPR justify the extent of the potential risks?
                    Many bioethicists find CRISPR especially difficult to justify ethically because of the
                    presence of other, less risky gene editing technologies. For example, preimplantation genetic
                    diagnosis, or PGD, allows doctors to make sure that the embryos that are implanted do not
                    possess altered genes, reducing the risk of a child being born with a genetic or chromosomal
                    disorder. Technologies such as these pose much smaller threats to the embryo and to future
                    generations of offspring, so many bioethicists argue that CRISPR and its potential benefits
                    cannot be justified due to the immense risk they pose.

                <h2> An Immediate Concern </h2>
                <p> Although debates around CRISPR gene editing technology often surround the effects
                  of these therapies on human beings, the use of CRISPR on plants, animals, and insects
                  is also highly debated. While editing human genomes is not done frequently as of now, CRISPR
                  is being used to modify insects, animals, plants, and microorganisms, making it a more
                  immediate ethical concern than the use of this technology on human beings. There are several
                  aspects of the debate surrounding the ethics of using CRISPR gene editing technology on other
                  organisms, as described below:
                </p>
            </article>

            <div class="indiv_study2">
              <article>
                  <h2> Genetically Modified Organisms </h2>
                  <p> Because it is so affordable and efficient, and because it has so many different
                    capabilities, CRISPR is being used often on plants, animals, insects, and other organisms in
                    order to produce human therapeutics and to benefit other fields of science and agriculture.
                    The issue is that some scientists believe there are not enough global regulations on the
                    creation of and the release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, also known
                    as GMOs. Although individual nations have regulatory programs, such as the United States’
                    Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, there are no unified international
                    guidelines on CRISPR and GMOs. If more effective regulations are not put in place soon, many
                    scientists believe that public trust and understanding of CRISPRtechnology and the creation
                    of GMOs will decline. This is because CRISPR may be used to create GMOs through an invalid use
                    of the technology and may be used in excess if not regulated properly. In addition, more
                    questions are raised surrounding GMOs when they are used for human consumption. Many consider
                    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s criteria for allowing GMOs to be consumed by humans
                    unclear and not transparent enough. As a result, many scientists believe that until the
                    criteria surrounding GMOs is not clarified, no animals or plants that have been genetically
                    modified to be used as food for humans, such as farm animals with enhanced nutritional content
                    and increased muscle mass, should be approved for public use.

                <h2> Unknown Consequences for the Environment </h2>
                <p> One of the key ethical concerns and main caveats regarding the use of CRISPR on plants,
                  animals, and other organisms is the potential effect on the environment and on ecosystems.
                  CRISPR can be used to tamper with the environment by editing the genes of certain species in
                  order to eradicate disease vectors and invasive species, such as by sterilizing male mosquitoes.
                  However, these kinds of alterations can cause lasting negative impacts on the environment and on
                  various ecosystems. Gene editing could destroy an entire species or have significant
                  environmental consequences, affecting other species that are reliant on the species that has
                  been edited. Many scientists believe that genetically modified plants should not even be grown
                  outdoors yet, since unintended environmental consequences could endanger human health and the
                  environment. For example, the use of Roundup Ready - genetically engineered crops - led to the
                  unintended consequences of the rise in glyphosate tolerant weeds and decreased biodiversity.
                  The main issue with the use of CRISPR on plants, animals, and other organisms is that the
                  technology is so new that it is difficult to provide certainty that the gene alterations made
                  will not have some unintended consequences, especially when those modified organisms are
                  introduced into an ecosystem and the environment as a whole.
